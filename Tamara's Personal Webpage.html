									<h2 class="major">Political Science Major</h2>
									<p>I decided to major in Political Science because I've always been fascinated by international relations and the ways through which our governmental systems affect our daily lives in ways we realize and don't. But if you ask my friends and family, they'll say it's because I have strong opinions and I like to argue.</p>

									<h2 class="major">Political Journalism</h2>
									<p>My goal through studying both Political Science and Writing was to become a political journalist or foreign coresspondent and travel the world reporting about major issues and events, to be where I can make a difference and write about the things that matter. However, considering who I am, where I'm from, and the direction I'd like to take with my journalism, being a reporter is too dangerous a career for me and my family.</p>

									<h2 class="major">Screenwriting</h2>
									<p>What I recently realized is that my true passion is storytelling, and if I can make a career out of it then why not? Even if it's a risky endeavor and I'm bound to fail a million times before I succeed. I realized that to make the impossible happen you need a comibantion of hard work and belief that it can happen, one is useless without the other.</p>
